# 🧠LLM-Familiarity
## Overview
This project establishes **LLM-derived familiarity norms** for **27,624 Simplified Chinese words**, with ratings **generated by** **GPT-4o** and **Qwen-max**.

This repository provides:
1.  **Immediate access** to the large-scale familiarity dataset.
2.  **Comprehensive source code** to facilitate research reproducibility and extension.

## 📥Accessing the Data

For researchers seeking direct access to the familiarity norms, all dataset files are organized in the `Data/2 norms` directory.

### Dataset Files
* **GPT-4o Derived Norms**:
    * `norms_gpt4o_character_prompt.xlsx` (via character prompt)
    * `norms_gpt4o_word_prompt.xlsx` (via word prompt)
    * `norms_gpt4o_expression_prompt.xlsx` (via expression prompt)
* **Qwen-max Derived Norms**:
    * `norms_qwen_max.xlsx` 

**Associated Resources**
* **Corresponding Prompt Templates**: The exact templates used to generate the data above are available in `Data/1 prompts/prompt_template.txt`.
* **Variable Dictionary**: For detailed definitions of all metrics and columns, please refer to `Data/Variable Descriptions.xlsx`.

## ⚙️Reproducing the Pipeline

For researchers aiming to replicate the generation and analysis process, the complete pipeline is open-sourced in the `Code` directory.

### Scripts
* **Generation**: `Code/01_generate_ratings.ipynb`
    * Executes API calls to generate familiarity ratings.
* **Analysis**: `Code/02_data_analysis.ipynb`
    * Performs data cleaning and validation.

### Key Configurations

| Model Version | Parameters | Sampling Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **GPT-4o-2024-08-06** | `Temperature=0`, `log_probs=True`, `top_logprobs=7` | Single API call (via log-probabilities) |
| **Qwen-max** | `Temperature=0.7` | Mean of 30 independent iterations |

> **Note on API Updates**: Given the rapid iteration of LLM services, we strongly recommend consulting the official API documentation for the latest interface specifications and parameter support prior to reproduction.

## 🚀Extending the Framework

This methodology is not limited to Simplified Chinese familiarity norms. We encourage researchers to extend this framework to other languages, models, and psycholinguistic variables.

### General Suggestions
* **Cross-Language & Model Extension**: Researchers are advised to first check if the target model's training corpus sufficiently covers the target language. We suggest conducting pilot tests to calibrate prompts and parameters before full-scale generation.
* **Cross-Variable Extension**: It is important to assess whether the target psycholinguistic variable is suitable for LLM-based estimation. Suitable variables typically possess:
    * Clear, operational definitions in natural language.
    * Established human norms in existing literature to facilitate alignment and validation (e.g., Age of Acquisition, Concreteness, Imageability).

### Prompt Design
Based on our observations, the following components may contribute to more effective prompt engineering:

* **Role Specification**: It is helpful to explicitly define the model's persona at the beginning (e.g., *"You are a native speaker of Simplified Chinese"*).
* **Construct Definition**: We recommend providing a rigorous, academic definition of the construct and specifying the rating scale in detail (e.g., *"1 to 7, where 1 represents the minimum..."*).
* **Language Alignment**:
    * *Prompt Language*: Consider the interaction between the prompt language and the model's training data. Our pilot tests suggest that performance may vary by prompt language; for instance, GPT-4o demonstrated superior performance on Chinese tasks when prompted in English.
    * *Target Emphasis*: It is beneficial to reinforce the target language context. For example, instructing the model to evaluate a *"Chinese word"* rather than a generic *"word"*.
* **Format Constraints**: Requesting strict output formats (e.g., *"Output numbers only"*) can help minimize hallucinations and facilitate downstream data cleaning.
* **Visual Emphasis**: Using **CAPITALIZATION** may help highlight critical instructions (e.g., *"A Chinese character is very FAMILIAR if you see/hear it often..."*).
  
  
### Pilot Protocol
Before executing large-scale generation, we suggest a pilot testing protocol similar to the following:

* **Stimuli Selection**: Select a representative subset of the target vocabulary. For instance, this study sampled approximately 10% of high-frequency Chinese vocabulary, covering lengths from single-character to four-character words.
* **Generation Strategy**:
    * *Log-probability Method*: If supported (e.g., GPT-4o), consider setting `Temperature=0` and extracting log-probabilities for a single-call estimate.
    * *Averaging Method*: If unsupported, consider performing multiple iterations (e.g., 3 runs) and calculating the mean to capture data distribution.
* **Data Cleaning**: Careful inspection is advisable even with format constraints. We recommend filtering out non-numeric outputs or potential "hallucinations."
* **Data Validation**: The quality of pilot data can be evaluated by:
    * Checking alignment (e.g., correlation) with human ratings (if available).
    * Assessing its explanatory power regarding lexical processing.
